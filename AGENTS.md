# Agent Guidelines

## Git Workflow

Feel free to **stage and commit** changes after finishing a block of work. However, **never push** to remote repositories unless explicitly instructed by the user.

When committing:
- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what changed and why
- Only commit files that are relevant to the work completed
- Avoid committing secrets, credentials, or sensitive files
