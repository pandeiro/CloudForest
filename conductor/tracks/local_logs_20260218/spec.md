# Specification: Configure basic log aggregation for local Docker containers\n\n## Overview\nThis track aims to establish a foundational log aggregation pipeline using Promtail, Loki, and Grafana to collect and visualize logs from Docker containers running on the local host.\n\n## Goals\n- Automatically discover and collect logs from all containers on the local Docker engine.\n- Store logs in Loki with appropriate labels (container name, image, etc.).\n- Visualize log data in Grafana using the Loki datasource.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Promtail successfully scrapes logs from the Docker socket.\n- Loki stores the ingested logs with relevant metadata.\n- A Grafana dashboard can query and display logs from at least one running container.\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- Use the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) for log discovery.\n- Ensure appropriate permissions for Promtail to read log files.\n- Maintain simple, well-documented configuration files.
